# BikeShare

This project addresses the rebalancing challenge by leveraging real-time demand prediction and incentivizing users to assist in the redistribution of bicycles. A demand prediction model was developed that predicts the demand at individual stations in the next 60 minutes, considering the historical data and recent trends. Based on these predictions, a reward-based mechanism was suggested to motivate the riders to redistribute bicycles from busy destination stations-where bike docking becomes scarce-to busy origin stations-where bikes are in short supply.
